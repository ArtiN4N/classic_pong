# Installation

Go to [release v1.1](https://github.com/ArtiN4N/classic_pong/releases/tag/v1.1) and install the zip file for your OS (GNU Linux or Windows).

<br>

## On GNU Linux

Download `classic_pong_linux.zip` into your directory of choice. Extract its contents using your file manager or with
```
unzip classic_pong_linux.zip
```
Then run the exectuable found at `classic_pong_linux/classic_pong_linux`. Running the executable from terminal probably wont load any sound effects.

classic_pong is confirmed to work on Debian-based systems.

<br>

## On Windows

Download `classic_pong_windows.zip` into your directory of choice. Extract its contents using some kind of UNZIP tool. Id reccomend [7ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org).

Double click `classic_pong_windows.exe` to start the game.

<br>

## On macOS

There's no official release for macOS systems. Look into [wine](https://www.winehq.org) to run the windows exe on macOS.
